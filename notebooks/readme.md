# How to get jupyter notebooks?

To facilitate nice Git workflow we use [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext).
See their manual for installation instruction and when creating your own notebooks.

To get Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb` out of a `.py` file using Jupyter Lab:
1. Have Jupytext installed.
2. Run Jupyter Lab.
3. In navigation sidebar right click on a `.py` file, select Open With -> Notebook.
4. Save the just opened notebook, new file with `.ipynb` extension should appear.
5. Enjoy the new notebook, don't forget to close `.py` file opened as notebook ;-)
