# Understanding Critical Neurons

## TODO in infrastructure and visualization
- effectively render multiple neurons from different layers
- different neuron sampling strategies 
- incorporate pruning and switching off neurons into mapped model (with caching)
- circuits backprop
- max activation search
- add GRADCam
- Jupyter notebook with example visualizations
